	- #### Legends and Anecdotes
		- did not become a celestial dragon with the other nineteen families and decided to return to Alabasta instead of moving to Mary Geoise
		- she mysteriously vanished on the way back and her younger brother took over as king
		- Earliest carrier of the Will of D.
		- Responsible for the presence of poneglyphs around the world
	- #### Weapons and Abilities
- Other stuff
	- I just think that the random ass civvy should be paired with one of the great queens â€” either the fishman queen fighting to bring unity between her kingdom and the world above, or the one member of the First Twenty who turned down the title of Celestial Dragon and ensured the presence of the poneglyphs
		- If Nefertari D. Lili is summoned that is BAD FUCKING NEWS for the poor master bc now the world government (more specifically the world government and their berserker king) are AFTER THEIR ASS
		- Would definitely ally with Sabo and Ace for protection
