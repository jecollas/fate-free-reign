- ## Characteristics
  collapsed:: true
	- Noble Phantasms manifest with Servants upon their summoning and are normally made of Magical Energy
		- Each one possesses a large amount of Magical Energy
			- Shows them as something outside of realm of normality — miracles that exceed both humanity and Magecraft
			- Makes it clear that they are Noble Phantasms, and differentiates them from normal weapons a Servant might possess
		- Can materialize and dematerialize at the wielder’s will
		- Activated by their true owners channeling Magical Energy into them and releasing their True Names
	- Since Noble Phantasms are tied directly into a hero’s legends, they usually belong to only one hero and are limited to their exclusive use
		- There are cases of a Noble Phantasm being possessed by multiple heroes
			- *The Hanging Gardens of Babylon* — Nebuchadnezzar II possesses it by deed, and Semiramis by distortion of face
		- A hero’s Noble Phantasm is not normally able to be wielded properly or activated by its True Name when it is being wielded by other heroes, whether it has been stolen or freely borrowed
			- There are specific Noble Phantasms that can temporarily transfer the ownership of armament Noble Phantasms
				- *Knight of Owner* — allows Lancelot to wield armament Noble Phantasms with great skill
				- *Blade Taker* — allows Toyotomi Hideyoshi to handle armament Noble Phantasms with less skill than the original wielder, but also be able to unleash their True Names under certain conditions
			- It may be possible for a Heroic Spirit 
			  to freely grant usage of the Noble Phantasm under certain exceptions
				- Requires the following conditions
					- “*being where he is making a contract, instead of being in opposition, of his own volition*"
					- "*the Noble Phantasm not requiring considerable skill and power to invoke its True Name.*”
				- Even with these conditions fulfilled, Rider of Black borrowing *Akhilleus Kosmos* from Rider of Red also required the respective episodes in their legends
					- “*the giver (Achilles) where he loans his Noble Phantasms*”
					- "*the receiver (Astolfo) where he borrows a Noble Phantasm*”
	- Most Heroic Spirits only possess one Noble Phantasm, with two or three being the usual limit
		- Some Servants have up to five Noble Phantasms, but those are very rare cases
	- Most Noble Phantasms are regarded as lost legends in modern times, but there are some that have remained throughout the millennia
		- Physical items that have remained throughout the ages and act as catalysts for summoning their wielders as Servants
			- Artoria’s Avalon
			- Jack the Ripper's knives
			- Qin Shi Huang’s Godfelling Crossbow
		- Humans who can actualize Noble Phantasms that have been passed down throughout their bloodlines for generations
- ## Strength and Ranking
	- Noble Phantasms are ranked by their strength and Mystery
		- The strength of a Noble Phantasm differs from the strength of a regular attack
			- A C-Rank Noble Phantasm is the equivalent of an A or A+ ranked normal attack
		- The average Noble Phantasm is around the level of B-Rank
			- Has strength able to be represented through numbers and shows only output of pure physical damage
			- Gáe Bolg's thrown strike is a pure destructive attack, while its piercing version carries a conceptual effect, a "*destiny interference type*", that falls into a special category
	- It is possible for the ranks of a Noble Phantasm to be increased or decreased depending upon certain circumstances
		- *Gáe Bolg* can temporarily be strengthened to A Rank through the use of Runes
		- *Clarent* loses ranks from having been obtained and used improperly
		- Defensive Noble Phantasms like *God Hand* and *Armor of Fafnir* use the concept of ranks as a means of defense rather than the relative power the ranks represent
	- It is possible to sacrifice a Noble Phantasm for an attack that is one rank higher
		- If a Noble Phantasm is packed with Magical Energy, it can be made to explode after striking its target
		- Known as a *Broken Phantasm*
		- It is nearly impossible to repair a destroyed Noble Phantasm,
			- and since they are the trump cards of Heroic Spirits, they are unlikely to take such measures
		- EMIYA is an exception, as he can reproduce as many copies of Noble Phantasms as his Magical Energy will allow due to Tracing, allowing him to also counterbalance the fact that all of his projections are lowered by one rank
		- If a Servant wishes to destroy their own weapon in another fashion, it is much easier than destroying one in normal combat
			- Diarmuid Ua Duibhne is able to easily break Gáe Buidhe in half without any effort.
- ## Classifications
	- Anti-Army and Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are able to kill hundreds of thousands of people, but Noble Phantasms capable of killing over ten thousand people are few in number
	- Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities.
	- **Anti-Unit** - specialize in defeating other people in single combat
		- Compared to stronger weapons, a majority of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms will not go beyond defeating other beings
			- Artoria's Invisible Air wouldn't increase the speed of an action like chopping wood
			- Cú Chulainn's Gáe Bolg, which strikes the opponent's heart, would just be a strong lance if the target is a rock or a house
		- The advantage over stronger weapons is that they can be compared to guns with unlimited ammo, while Anti-Army Noble Phantasms are one-time missiles
			- Missiles are more powerful, but an Anti-Unit can be continuous (like Invisible Air)
		- There are also those that are very cost effective like Gáe Bolg, so it can be called a sure-hit arrow that is better at killing single people than a cannonball
	- **Anti-Unit (Self)** - used upon the wielder instead of another target
	- **Anti-Army** - have a wide enough range to be specialized against armies
		- They are more powerful weapons than Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms, capable of easily blowing them away, but they must be used more wisely because of their larger cost
			- Using an A Rank Noble Phantasm takes a great deal of mana, so they must wait before they can use it again.
	- **Anti-Army (Self)** - used upon the wielder's own army instead of another group
	- **Anti-City** - has enough range to potentially cover an entire city
	- **Anti-Country** - has enough range to potentially cover an entire country
	- **Anti-Divine** - effective against Divine Spirits
	- **Anti-Fortress** - powerful Noble Phantasms that can even blow away solid fortified structures
		- While the difference between Anti-Unit and Anti-Army is the variation in area of effect, Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are distinguished from other categories by the great difference in power
			- Only Excalibur has this rank in all of the Noble Phantasms of the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars
	- **Anti-Gate** - has power capable of blowing away sturdy walls, doors and gates
	- **Anti-King** - effective against those with the King attribute
	- **Anti-Mind** - targets the mind
	- **Anti-Populace** - targets the people, whether they are of the masses or they are that of a civilization
	- **Anti-Team** - The classification of Aestus Domus Aurea, which creates a Golden Theater in which everything is advantageous to Nero. While deployed, enemies trapped are weakened and buildings can be customized by changing its shapes and 
	  functions
	- **Anti-Thaumaturgy** - meant to be used for the dispelling and destruction of Magecraft and other Thaumaturgy
	- **Anti-Treasure** - targets other treasures, potentially including Noble Phantasms
	- **Anti-World** - The classification of Noble Phantasms that affect the World itself, such as Enuma Elish
		- While the actual output is around the level of Excalibur, Enuma Elish's effect of unquestionably being that of the legend of "*ripping the world*" puts the sword in a special category
	- **Barrier** - used to create barriers (typically Bounded Fields). It does not include those that are also used to attack
		- Avalon is purely defensive, so it is a typical example of a barrier
		- While other Noble Phantasms like Blood Fort Andromeda may create barriers, they will instead be classified by their ability to attack like Blood Fort Andromeda belonging to the Anti-Army category
	- **Conceptual**
	- **Fortress** - those that consist of solid fortified structures.
		- Fortress Noble Phantasms are very rare, fewer in number than even the rare Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms
	- **Labyrinth** - bring forth a Labyrinth or something similar to the concept of a maze
	- **Suicide Attack** - sacrifice the user's life like La Pucelle
