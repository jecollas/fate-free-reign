- General info
	- Noble Phantasms are powerful armaments made using human imagination as their core, and are the weapons and/or abilities owned by Heroic Spirits
	- They embody the ultimate Mysteries of a hero as symbols of their existence through historical fact and anecdotes
		- Physical weaponry (e.g. swords, spears, bows)
		- Support items (e.g. shields, rings, crowns)
		- Abstractions, such as unique, often magical abilities (even close to or matching True Magic), unique (even conceptual) means of attack, curses, and changes to the very environment and its physical properties
	- They are the trump cards of the heroes summoned as Servants in the Holy Grail War that allow them to overcome others in battle
- Characteristics
	- Noble Phantasms are the symbols of a Heroic Spirit's existence
		- They represent a Heroic Spirit's legends, the anecdotes about their prowess, and the weaponry they treasured in life
		- As the embodiment of a hero, they are trump cards carried by each to be used at an appropriate time (i.e. during battle)
		- Using them would most likely reveal a Heroic Spirit's identity
		- Most Noble Phantasms only belong to a single hero, and can only be activated by their true owners channeling Magical Energy into them and releasing their True Names
	-
	- Most Noble Phantasms only belong to a single hero and can only be activated by their true owners channeling Magical Energy into them and releasing their True Names
		- There are cases as with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon which is possessed by multiple heroes
			- Nebuchadnezzar II possessing it by deed
			- Semiramis possessing it by distortion of fact
	- They each possess a great amount of Magical Energy that show them being things "*outside of normality*", miracles exceeding both humanity and Magecraft
	- Noble Phantasms are brought into the world with Servants upon their 
	  summoning, normally complied out of Magical Energy and granted the ability to materialize and dematerialize at the wielder's will.
		- Compared to the Servants who sometimes also possesses normal weapons as well, they give off a clear level of Magical Energy that shows that they are Noble Phantasms
	- Most Heroic Spirits will only possess one Noble Phantasm
		- Two or three is normally the absolute limit, it may be possible for someone to have had three or four extraordinary weapons in their life
	- It is possible that Noble Phantasms will be granted to heroes even if they had nothing to do with them in life
		- such as the misunderstandings of countless people thinking Semiramis had some connection to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, causing it to become her Noble Phantasm.
	- Noble Phantasms are ranked by their strength and Mystery
		- Those called "*extremely average*" are around the level of B-Rank which have strength able to be represented through numbers and show only output of pure physical damage
			- Gáe Bolg's thrown strike is a pure destructive attack, while its piercing version carries a conceptual effect, a "*destiny interference type*", that falls into a special category
		- Noble Phantasms differ from regular attacks
			- A C-Rank Noble Phantasm is the equivalent of an A or A+ ranked normal attack
			- It is possible for the ranks to be increased or decreased depending upon certain circumstances
				- Gáe Bolg can temporarily be strengthened to A Rank through the use of Runes
				- Clarent loses ranks from having been obtained and used improperly
				- Defensive Noble Phantasms like God Hand and Armor of Fafnir use the concept of ranks as a means of defense rather than the relative power the ranks represent
	- Fortress Noble Phantasms are very rare, fewer in number than even the rare Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms
		- Even those that own them like Cú Chulainn can only use it within his homeland of Ireland
		- Floating fortresses like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are close to zero
	- Anti-Army and Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are able to kill hundreds of thousands of people
		- Noble Phantasms capable of killing over ten thousand people are few in number
	- Normally limited to the exclusive usage of their owners due to being tied directly into their legends, the Noble Phantasms of heroes being wielded by other heroes will not normally be able to be wielded properly by them or activated with their True Names, whether stolen or freely borrowed
		- There are specific Noble Phantasms like Knight of Owner and Blade Taker that can temporarily transfer the ownership of armament Noble Phantasms, allowing Lancelot to wield them with great skill and Toyotomi Hideyoshi to handle them with less skill than the original wielder but also be able to unleash their True Names under certain conditions.
	- Under certain exceptions, it may be possible for a Heroic Spirit 
	  to freely grant usage of the Noble Phantasm, requiring the conditions of “*being where he is making a contract, instead of being in opposition, of his own volition*" and "*the Noble Phantasm not requiring considerable skill and power to invoke its True Name.*” Even with such conditions fulfilled, Rider of Black borrowing Akhilleus Kosmos from Rider of Red also required the respective episodes in their legends of “*the giver (Achilles) where he loans his Noble Phantasms*” and "*the receiver (Astolfo) where he borrows a Noble Phantasm.*”
	- The most common Noble Phantasms are holy swords and demonic swords used by heroes during their lives
		- There is no specific form into which they must fit
		- They can be the weapons the hero used in life, and they can be famous anecdotes about the hero given form upon their ascension
		- While they can be physical weapons, the act of throwing many weapons at once or a "*sword that splits into an infinite number*" could be Noble Phantasms in themselves
	- Rin Tohsaka provides several examples of a Noble Phantasm's power
		- Dragon-slaying swords
		- Shoes that can run far and wide
		- God-killing demonic swords
		- **Hazanken**, a sword in Chinese legends able to even slice through mountains that can only be swung once
		- There are those like Ionioi Hetairoi that is Alexander the Great's life sublimated into a Noble Phantasm due to having been acknowledged by all as the King of Conquerors,
		- There are those like Zabaniya that are Noble Phantasms because of their status as that which establishes their users as Hassan-i-Sabbah rather than having been recorded in history
	- Most Noble Phantasms are simply regarded as lost legends in 
	  modern times, but there are some that have remained throughout the millennia
		- There are humans like Bazett Fraga McRemitz and Gray that can actualize Noble Phantasms that have been passed down throughout their bloodlines for generations
		- Others like Avalon, Jack the Ripper's knives, and the Godfelling Crossbow owned by Qin Shi Huang have remained throughout the ages and act as catalysts for summoning their wielders as Servants.
	- It is possible to sacrifice a Noble Phantasm for an attack that is one rank higher, which is called a **Broken Phantasm: The Destroyed Illusion**. If a Noble Phantasm is packed with Magical Energy, it can be made to explode after striking its target
		- It is nearly impossible to repair a destroyed Noble Phantasm, and since they are the trump cards of Heroic Spirits, they are unlikely to take such measures
		- EMIYA is an exception, as he can reproduce as many copies of Noble Phantasms as his Magical Energy will allow due to Tracing, allowing him to also counterbalance the fact that all of his projections are lowered by one rank
		- If a Servant wishes to destroy their own weapon in another fashion, it is much easier than destroying one in normal combat
			- Diarmuid Ua Duibhne is able to easily break Gáe Buidhe in half without any effort.
- Classifications
	- Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities.
		- **Anti-Unit** - specialize in defeating other people in single combat
			- Compared to stronger weapons, a majority of Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms will not go beyond defeating other beings
				- Artoria's Invisible Air wouldn't increase the speed of an action like chopping wood
				- Cú Chulainn's Gáe Bolg, which strikes the opponent's heart, would just be a strong lance if the target is a rock or a house
			- The advantage over stronger weapons is that they can be compared to guns with unlimited ammo, while Anti-Army Noble Phantasms are one-time missiles
				- Missiles are more powerful, but an Anti-Unit can be continuous (like Invisible Air)
			- There are also those that are very cost effective like Gáe Bolg, so it can be called a sure-hit arrow that is better at killing single people than a cannonball
			- **Anti-Unit (Self)** - used upon the wielder instead of another target
		- **Anti-Army** - have a wide enough range to be specialized against armies
			- They are more powerful weapons than Anti-Unit Noble Phantasms, capable of easily blowing them away, but they must be used more wisely because of their larger cost
				- Using an A Rank Noble Phantasm takes a great deal of mana, so they must wait before they can use it again.
			- **Anti-Army (Self)** - used upon the wielder's own army instead of another group
		- **Anti-City** - has enough range to potentially cover an entire city
		- **Anti-Country** - has enough range to potentially cover an entire country
		- **Anti-Divine** - effective against Divine Spirits
		- **Anti-Fortress** - powerful Noble Phantasms that can even blow away solid fortified structures
			- While the difference between Anti-Unit and Anti-Army is the variation in area of effect, Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms are distinguished from other categories by the great difference in power
				- Only Excalibur has this rank in all of the Noble Phantasms of the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars
		- **Anti-Gate** - has power capable of blowing away sturdy walls, doors and gates
		- **Anti-King** - effective against those with the King attribute
		- **Anti-Mind** - targets the mind
		- **Anti-Populace** - targets the people, whether they are of the masses or they are that of a civilization
		- **Anti-Team** - The classification of Aestus Domus Aurea, which creates a Golden Theater in which everything is advantageous to Nero. While deployed, enemies trapped are weakened and buildings can be customized by changing its shapes and 
		  functions
		- **Anti-Thaumaturgy** - meant to be used for the dispelling and destruction of Magecraft and other Thaumaturgy
		- **Anti-Treasure** - targets other treasures, potentially including Noble Phantasms
		- **Anti-World** - The classification of Noble Phantasms that affect the World itself, such as Enuma Elish
			- While the actual output is around the level of Excalibur, Enuma Elish's effect of unquestionably being that of the legend of "*ripping the world*" puts the sword in a special category
		- **Barrier** - used to create barriers (typically Bounded Fields). It does not include those that are also used to attack
			- Avalon is purely defensive, so it is a typical example of a barrier
			- While other Noble Phantasms like Blood Fort Andromeda may create barriers, they will instead be classified by their ability to attack like Blood Fort Andromeda belonging to the Anti-Army category
		- **Conceptual**
		- **Fortress** - those that consist of solid fortified structures.
		- **Labyrinth** - bring forth a Labyrinth or something similar to the concept of a maze
		- **Suicide Attack** - sacrifice the user's life like La Pucelle
