- ## Servant Classes
	- ### [[Saber]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
		  collapsed:: true
			- Agile and powerful melee warriors who are adept at swordsmanship and boast high ratings in all categories
			- Often heroes from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace
			- The qualifying conditions of this class require Heroic Spirits to have legends as knights of the sword
				- This class requires the highest levels of attributes in all but the Magic attribute
				- Status qualifications can be bypassed in special circumstances
					- Example: Nero Claudius's Imperial Privilege
				- Compatible Heroic Spirits usually excel in delivering powerful burst attacks
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
		  collapsed:: true
			- The standard opinion is that the Saber Class is the best of the seven classes and the strongest of the Servants
				- Sabers are said to have made it to the final battle in the first four Fuyuki wars
			- Sabers generally have an overwhelming advantage over servants who use magecraft as their main offensive ability (such as Caster-class Servants) due to their Magic Resistance Skill
			- The weakness of this class is its straightforwardness in battle
				- They are only able to attack the enemy with their sword
				- Unable to resort to other tactics like Presence Concealment
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
			- **Abilities**
				- [Anti-Magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic):
				  collapsed:: true
					- From their Class Skill, Magic Resistance.
				- [Cool Sword](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword):
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is, unsurprisingly, the default Saber Noble Phantasm. The easiest way to qualify for this class if you're not a [Master Swordsman](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman) is to be associated with a particularly famous sword.
				- [Lightning Bruiser](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Most Sabers have very high physical stats, making them well-rounded melee experts.
					- The Saber class is often dubbed the "strongest class" because, while not necessarily home to the strongest Heroic Spirits, it's the most *consistent* in giving strong, sturdy, and fast fighters.
					- They also tend to have fairly high stats in both HP and ATK compared to the other classes.
				- [Master Swordsman](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman):
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is the whole point of the class - give or take the occasional weird exception (because this is, after all, the Nasuverse, where technicalities and [Loophole Abuse](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse) reign supreme), Sabers are historical/mythological figures famous for being really good with swords.
				- [Poor, Predictable Rock](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorPredictableRock):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Lorewise, the biggest weakness of Sabers is that they're only really capable of head-on attacks (being the class of armored knights and whatnot), and excluding their Noble Phantasms their effective range is often only the length of their sword.
					- While they might outclass other Servants in terms of general parameters, their lack of versatility makes it possible for the "weaker" classes (like Caster and Assassin) to maneuver around them and take them down with guile.
						- Furthermore, it makes Sabers a poor match with Masters who favor a [Combat Pragmatist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist) approach for fighting.
						- [This isn't much of a factor in gameplay](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation), though, since Sabers in-game are just one of many classes with advantages and disadvantages against others.
						- It does however provide the basis for their weakness against Archers, as they are all largely projectile uses that can attack a saber multiple times in lore before they get close.
				- [Sword Beam](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Excalibur set the trend, and this is an extremely common thing for Sabers' swords to be capable of.
					- Sometimes it'll be the main attraction, a city-wrecking [Kamehame Hadoken](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken) that few can stand against, and sometimes it'll just be a minor part of a versatile arsenal.
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Gameplay and Story Integration](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The Saber class is revered for producing consistently high-tier Servants. In *Grand Order*, only *one* Saber is bronze-rank and only four are silver.
				- [Overused Copycat Character](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedCopycatCharacter):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The "Saber Wars" event not only pulls a [Lampshade Hanging](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging) on this trope, but plays the number of Saber-faces for laughs, with Mysterious Heroine X (who is [definitely not Altria](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial)) hunting them down.
					- Additionally, most Sabers have the *exact same* card setup: QAABB, with about half of those having a Buster Noble Phantasm while the other half has an Arts Noble Phantasm. In fact, this card setup is often referred to as the "Saber deck".
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Sabers are strong against Lancers, but weak against Archers.
					- They are also both strong and weak against Berserkers, are resisted by Rulers, take extra damage from demon pillars and Pretenders and resist Alteregos.
			- **Misc**
				- [Knight in Shining Armor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The class card depicts a typical knight in full armor with their sword in position.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A somewhat broader hat than [some](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FateGrandOrderLancers) [others](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FateGrandOrderRiders) (Lancers and Riders), but still there.
					- Part of the reason Saber is a "stronger" class is that its candidates generally have more "[Mystery](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter)", in the Nasuverse sense, about them - which is to say, they're *older* Heroic Sprits, with the general cut-off point being ~1500CE.
					- Most of the Sabers from after 1500 are either [event-related joke characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified) or one specific crossover character for fans of another part of the Nasuverse.
					- The remaining four who *are* serious characters despite being "younger" (d'Eon, Tajima-no-kami, Musashi, and Lakshmi Bai) are all treated as fairly remarkable, and in *Epic of Remnant* and *Cosmos in the Lostbelt* each one is given a narrative spotlight to show exactly *why* they make the cut as a Saber despite their relative age.
						- Even the [Joke Character](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter) Okita is repeatedly shown to be a great swordsman and a dangerous opponent in spite of her poor stats and perpetual illness.
					- More specifically, it is implied that any [Knight of the Round Table](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend), by virtue of their history, association with King Arthur/Altria, and combat skills, are likelier to be Sabers than otherwise.
						- Other Knights who did not debut as Sabers within the franchise (like Galahad, Gareth and Lancelot) are eventually given Saber alternate forms.
						- As of 2022, the only outliers are Tristan (an Archer who is explicitly noted to "actually" be a Saber), Percival (a Lancer) and Agravain (labeled as an Assassin in a promotional card).
				- [Square Race, Round Class](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass):
				  collapsed:: true
					- While the Saber container is one of the most coveted and powerful in any Holy Grail War, a number of Servants who are compatible with it such as Jason and Caesar claim that they'd be more effective in a different Class.
	- ### [[Archer]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
			- Frequently Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace
			- The qualifying condition for the Heroic Spirits is not attributes, but instead the possession of powerful projectile weapons or special abilities related to projectile weapons
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
			- Servants placed within this Class excel in possessing powerful Noble Phantasms, are able to act as highly effective scouts
			- Servants will generally assume that the Noble Phantasm of an Archer-class Servant is their bow, but any projectile weapons, even firearms, can be indicative of an Archer
			- Class Skills
				- Magic Resistance — most modern magi are unable to inflict damage to them
				- Independent Action — allows them the ability to act independently for a length of time without an active supply of magical energy from their Master
					- For Archers with high ranked Independent Action and a disposition opposite to the Master, the only guaranteed way to control them is through the use of Command Spells.
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
			- **Abilities**
				- [Abnormal Ammo](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo):
				  collapsed:: true
					- While most Archers do use traditional projectile weapons like guns and bow and arrows, there are a few who don't conform to this, most notably Gilgamesh and Jeanne D'Arc.
				- [Always Accurate Attack](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack):
				  collapsed:: true
					- About half of the single-target Archer roster have some form of Sure Hit or Ignore Invincibility to pierce Evasion, whether tied to their Noble Phantasm or skills
					- Notably, most of these Archers are "free to play" and easily obtainable by diligent players, so Archers tend to be a backup option for an Evasion-piercing squad.
					- Even some AoE Archers like Nikola Tesla and Ishtar join in on the Evasion-piercing action.
				- [Anti-Magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic):
				  collapsed:: true
					- From their Class Skill, Magic Resistance.
				- [Damager, Healer, Tank](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Notable in this regard - a lot of other Classes tend to have a spread of Servants who can fill a variety of roles (being tank-like, or straight healers, or otherwise supportive, etc). Archers are almost *exclusively* hard-core damage monsters.
					- Until the release of Superhuman Orion, every other Archer in this game has gotten an offensive Noble Phantasm, making it the only main class that didn't have Servants with non-offensive Noble Phantams up to that point.
					- Among Extra Classes that shared the same distinction were the Alter Ego class and and the Moon Cancer class, the former being also noted for its offensively-orientated members and the latter having only very few members to begin with.
				- [Long-Range Fighter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Most of the Servants in this class are specialized in ranged-combat but not much in close combat.
					- While there are some who are no slouch in close combat (like Emiya and Arjuna), they are still more effective at a distance.
						- However, [range has little bearing in gameplay](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation).
				- [Non-Indicative Name](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The class is called Archer, but really covers all Heroic Spirits skilled at ranged combat. This means there are "Archers" who use guns, or a sling, or fire melee weapons out of portals.
						- That said, any *actual* archer summoned under this class are a [Master Archer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterArcher)by default.
					- Even if they use lightning or telekinesis, if it's not magecraft, the Servant will be placed into Archer instead of Caster.
						- It's [lampshaded](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded) in Arjuna's Trial Quest, where Mash tells the amnesic Arjuna that just because he has a bow that doesn't automatically make him an Archer, to which he replies that they must know some...rather unique heroes.
					- Lore wise, there is an Extra class that focuses on guns, Gunner, that would replace Archer in a proper war, all known servants that qualify for it, qualify for Archer anyways.
					- This verity of weapons was actually explained by Fate/complete material III, as such:
						- *The qualifying condition for the Heroic Spirits [of the Archer class] is not attributes, but instead the possession of powerful projectile weapons or special abilities related to projectile weapons. Servants will generally assume that the Noble Phantasm of an Archer-class Servant is their bow, but any projectile weapons, even firearms, can be indicative of an Archer.*
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Critical Hit Class](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The Archer class has the second-highest base Star Gathering hidden stat in-game, hovering around 150, letting them gather more Critical Stars than most other classes
						- In comparison, the highest are Riders with 200 while the lowest include Berserkers at *10*
					- Most Archers are further defined by their passive Class Skill, Independent Action, which increases their Critical Strength.
					- Molded around this base are a sizeable number of Archers who have more skills to increase their Critical Hit damage capacity.
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Archers have an advantage against Sabers due to Saber's lack of long-range attacks, and a weakness against Lancers due to their high agility.
					- They also have the common strength and weakness against Berserkers, lowered damage dealt to Rulers and are defensively weak to the Demon Pillars.
			- **Misc**
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Played with regarding Indian Servants:
					- Many Indian heroes in their original stories emphasize archery and the like. In practice, only two Indian Servants in this game are Archers, three if you count *Arcade*
						- Arjuna and Ashwatthama in the main game and Sita as an *Arcade* exclusive.
						- They are later followed here by the goddess Durga/Kali—who ironically does not have a bow amongst her visible weaponry.
					- Karna, Rama and Kama can qualify as Archers, and in case of the latter, she still uses a bow and arrow even as an Assassin, and her profile even states that [she should really be in the Archer class](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareRaceRoundClass).
						- Some of these even have the ability to act as Archers while in other classes;
						- Rama's Armory of Vishnu NP is described as granting him all the advantages of all three Knight classes in one Servant.
	- ### [[Lancer]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
			- The qualifying conditions to be placed within the class are second only to the Saber class, requiring overall excellent attributes and a high agility attribute
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
			- Servants placed within this class display excellent close combat skills, show proficiency in hit-and-run tactics that capitalize on range and speed, and are skilled with long-range melee weapons such as spears and lances
				- Many of which are Heroic Spirits who were knights
			- Their only particular class ability is Magic Resistance, and although they "tend to be less flashy than the other classes", they display great reliability
		- #### Shared Tropes
			- **Personality**
				- [Born Unlucky](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky):
				  collapsed:: true
					- On average, Lancer-class Servants have an abysmal Luck stat and often have tragic backstories, on top of being [Cosmic Playthings](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything) who are screwed over at every turn despite their best efforts.
			- **Abilities**
				- [Anti-Magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic):
				  collapsed:: true
					- From their Class Skill, Magic Resistance.
				- [Fragile Speedster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster):
				  collapsed:: true
					- One of the defining characteristics of most Lancers is that they tend to have a rather high Agility stat (usually around A-rank)
						- By comparison, however, their Endurance stat is often around C-rank at best.
					- In gameplay terms, most Lancers are damage dealers with no defensive abilities and most generally have a Quick-oriented deck (usually QQABB setup, but some have a QQAAB setup, especially Arts-oriented Lancers like Fionn and Li Shuwen).
					- Although, most Lancers tend to have Buster Noble Phantasms.
				- [Nonindicative Name](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName):
				  collapsed:: true
					- If you're not familiar with earlier works in the Fate series, you might think at first that they are a mounted class similar to Rider since "they are named after a type of cavalryman" (lance being a spear *specifically* designed for cavalry use), but all of them except Altria actually fight on foot.
					- Additionally very few actually wield a lance, with most preferring a spear, [scythe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe), or other polearm (indeed, most of them are better classified as pikemen infantry-type fighters, based on their weaponry and skill-set).
						- Lancer Tamamo, being a [Fighting Clown](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown), somehow gets away with an umbrella.
				- [Situational Sword](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Several Lancers are able to deal extra damage against certain enemies with specific traits.
					- In fact, five out of eight 5* Lancers do, including every 5* Lancer with a single-target Noble Phantasm.
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Power Creep](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Almost every Lancer in the game has at least two Quick cards in their deck (Kagetora and Romulus-Quirinus being the sole exceptions).
					- However, the Lancers of the game's early lifespan have suffered from their poor Critical Star Drop Rates and low hit counts, making it difficult for them to drop Critical Stars, even with Quick Chains.
						- This is noticeable with Lancers with Critical Hit-focused skillsets, who are unable to drop enough Critical Stars for themselves to gather.
					- Similarly, those Lancers also tend to suffer from poor NP Gain, thus they take it longer to fill their NP Gauge.
					- Many of the later Lancers eventually have far more efficient Critical Star Drops and better NP Gain than their senior colleagues.
						- To keep the seniors relevant, many of them were given [Balance Buff](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff).
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Lancers have an advantage against Archers and a weakness against Sabers.
					- They also have the common strength and weakness against Berserkers and resistance from Rulers, as well as a defensive weakness to the Demon Pillars.
			- **Misc**
				- [Knight in Shining Armor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Their class card depicts a lightly armored infantryman wielding a long spear.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A *lot* of Irish Servants tend to be Lancers, or at least have a Lancer version. Of the six Irish Servants (not counting alternate copies of themselves), the only ones who *aren't* able to be Lancers (at this point) are Medb (Rider and Saber) and Fergus mac Róich (Saber-only).
					- At least around the start of the game's life, the earlier Lancers tend to have a QQABB deck that emphasizes both speed and power, as well as either Buster or Quick NP. Nowadays their card layouts are more varied.
	- ### [[Rider]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
		  collapsed:: true
			- Servants placed within this Class are those known for riding mounts, whether living beasts or human constructs, during their lives
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
		  collapsed:: true
			- They generally have lower attributes compared to the Three Knight Classes, but the abilities of the mounts described in their legends compensate by granting them powerful Noble Phantasms or abilities
			- Class Skills
				- They have the class abilities of Magic Resistance and a high rank in Riding
				- Riding — allows them to fully utilize the abilities of their mounts
					- Depending on the rank, they can take full control of everything from simple horses, modern machinery like motorcycles and planes, and even Divine Beasts
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
				- [Non-Indicative Name](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Much like Archers, it's something of a joke in the fandom that while the name "Rider" calls to mind a classical cavalier fighting on horseback, this only covers a fairly small number of Riders.
					- The vast majority of Riders fight on foot—a surprising number don't utilize any kind of mount or vehicle at all in combat, and the ones that do often only make use of it in a handful of attacks or maybe their Noble Phantasm.
					- Pretty much the only ones you could tell are Riders at first glance are Iskandar, Europa, Habetrot, and Dobrynya Nikitich (ironically, the first Servant to *actually* stay on horseback all the time was a *Lancer*).
					- Much of this is because the qualifications for Rider can be pretty loose; not only do cavaliers and charioteers qualify, but also ship captains, vehicle pilots, beast tamers, people who rely on bodyguards or troops, and people with animalistic aspects (and then there's Medb who "rides men").
					- Plus, showing off the nature of your ride represents a pretty big clue to your true identity and eats a lot of mana, so most of them save it for their trump card.
			- **Abilities**
				- [Anti-Magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic):
				  collapsed:: true
					- From their Class Skill, Magic Resistance, though it's weaker than the Three Knight Classes.
				- [Cool Horse](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse):
				  collapsed:: true
					- One of the prerequisites for a Heroic Spirit to be classified in the Rider class is having a mount, be it animals, phantasmal species, or vehicles.
					- Or in the case of Medb, [men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism).
					- It's taken even further with Red Hare, who *is* a Cool Horse.
				- [Four-Star Badass](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Rider as a class tends to include a fair few heroic generals or rulers of nations, as many of them can be defined by "riding" an army and often had specialized mounts they used on the battlefield or are famous for innovating warfare via transportation.
					- A number of them (like Iskandar, Ozymandias and Medb) also tend to be quite powerful due to the breadth of their accomplishment and legend.
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Critical Hit Class](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In-game, as their Class Skill, Riding, can increase the power of Quick cards, which indirectly increases the chance of getting stars (which determine critical hit chance).
					- They also have high star attraction values, meaning that their cards are more likely to have a higher crit rate, although they tend to suffer from slightly lower base stats than normal compared to other classes.
				- [Gameplay and Story Segregation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Nominally, the Rider class's Magic Resistance in the [Nasuverse](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse) is supposedly weaker than the Knight classes.
					- In-game, however, Magic Resistance is a passive skill shared by many Servants and applies only to debuffs, not to magic usage altogether (which means they are equal to the Knight classes in this aspect).
					- Furthermore, due to the Rider class's collective resistance to Casters, their actual resistance to magic use is far stronger than the Knight classes (who still receive neutral damage).
				- [Money Grinding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyGrinding):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The in-game currency (Quantum Piece/QP) needed to power up all Servants (be it levels, Noble Phantasms and/or skills) is best farmed via defeating Caster-type "door" enemies in Daily Quests.
					- Basic [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](safari-reader://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors) shows it's best to deploy wave-clearing capable Riders specifically for this purpose.
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Riders have an advantage against Casters and a weakness against Assassins.
					- They also have the common strength and weakness against Berserkers, reduced damage dealt to Rulers, a weakness to Alter Egos (but not reduced offense) and an offensive advantage against Demon God Pillars.
			- **Misc**
				- [Anachronism Stew](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Not on the Servants or the class itself but on the class card. It depicts a fully armored soldier on a chariot
						- However full plate armor is only used by the time that chariot warfare had been already replaced by the cavalry.
				- [Horseback Heroism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsebackHeroism):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Their class card depicts an armored knight driving a chariot.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A bit like Lancers and Irishmen, a good number of Riders tend to come from the Mediterranean and the "Near East".
					- This makes sense, as a *lot* of the innovation and famous conquests involving horses and vehicles occurred in this area of the world.
					- In addition to all the ones on this page, *Fate* lore says that Perseus is primarily this Class as well.
					- Furthermore, if a Heroic Spirit is from the [Age of Sail or the Golden Age of Piracy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen) (as well as having [anything naval/marine-related](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfNavalWarfare) to their legend and achievements), it is *very* likely they will be a Rider because of how closely they're associated with ships.
					- Many of Lancer-class Servants or those qualifies there also qualifies as Rider and vice-versa, as polearms are usually associated with cavalry.
					- Around the start of the game's life, earlier Riders tended to have QQAAB deck with either Quick or Arts NP. Nowadays, their card layouts are a lot more varied, to the point that, unlike the other classes, there really isn't a "standard" Rider card layout.
	- ### [[Caster]]
		- #### Qualifications
			- Casters are usually adept in magecraft
			- The only qualifying condition is the mastery of sorceries of the highest caliber
				- Don’t need any strong statistics
				- Casters generally have low combat abilities because of that
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
		  collapsed:: true
			- Thought to be the weakest Class because most Servants have some form of Magic Resistance
				- Casters can make up for this in other ways
					- Using magecraft that no longer exists in the current age
					- Having many possible ploys that can be used against enemies regardless of Class
				- Sabers (who have high Magic Resistance) can usually challenge any Caster who uses magecraft as their main offensive ability without needing to plan
				- Riders (who have a lower Magic Resistance) may need more of a strategy
			- Class abilities
				- Territory Creation — allows them to alter the surrounding lands in favor of their sorcery
				- Item Construction —  allows the magus to create magical items and tools
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
				- [Brains Evil, Brawn Good](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsEvilBrawnGood):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Most Casters are either amoral, or simply insufferable, with very few of them being outright heroic in character.
					- One of the most notable exceptions is Illya, because only because she's the *Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA* version; if it was the original Illya from *Fate/stay night*, she'd fit the trope to a T
					- The innocent Sanzang is a Caster who fits the other half of the trope, since she's a very offensive-orientated Caster and she's not particularly the brightest person out there.
				- [The Friend Nobody Likes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Casters are generally looked down upon or with suspicion by the other Classes due to their difficult personalities, indirect fighting styles, and penchant for misanthropic cunning. Certain Masters may look down upon Casters due to them being the weakest of the classes (since most other classes have Magic Resistance).
			- **Abilities**
				- [The Archmage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage):
				  collapsed:: true
					- They're the magic-using class, so the most powerful Casters will qualify as this by default (and nearly all Casters count as this when compared to baseline humans)
					- Either it's what they were most famous for when they were alive, or it's how their intellectual/artistic achievements translate into superpowers through the Servant system.
				- [Art Imitates Life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtImitatesLife):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The reason why there's a significant number of artists and scientists in this class is because of the Heroic Spirit of Man category. Heroic Spirits of this category are people who made their name in history purely through their deeds and not supernatural interference, making it possible for people of ordinary descent to reach the Throne
					- As the artists' 'heroic' deeds were done through their creations, this trope is the reason why they can be Heroic Spirits in the first place. The Caster class is the only class container that can materialize them.
					- Funnily enough, a lot of this also ends up applying to *Nero Claudius Caesar*, too, despite her being much older than the other examples; she's still Man category (since she was largely just a mortal emperor), and she was an enormous patron of the arts and a creator of art (well, "art") herself, which all means that when she manifests as Caster, she's actually surprisingly powerful, especially since she also has the concept of "Imperial Privilege", as a force that allows her to do things because she's Emperor, backing her up, on top of her own latent potential as a Magus.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- As explained above, many artists and scientists tend to be within this class thanks to their "heroic deeds" being done through their creations.
					- Most of them tend to have a triple Arts deck, and their Noble Phantasm tend to be either for support or for AOE attacks.
				- [Powers via Weapon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersViaWeapon):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Another way to qualify for the Caster class is to have access to magical items and weapons. For example, Gilles de Reis counts as a Caster because of Prelati's spell book and Gilgamesh qualifies because of all the magic items in his treasury.
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Com Mons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons):
				  collapsed:: true
					- *THE* single most numerous class in the game, with quite a large amount of Servants from the Friend point summon being casters. By the time most players will start getting other classes' Noble Phantasms upgraded, they'll likely have the Friend Point Casters already at Noble Phantasm 5.
				- [Gameplay and Story Segregation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The above bits about how they stack up against various classes, and struggle against a number of them? For gameplay, ignore it; "Magic Resistance" is *debuff* resistance in this game, and while a fair few Casters have debuffs, MR doesn't affect their damage in any way. They also don't struggle *that* much against any of the "knight trio" damage-wise, since they deal neutral damage to them and are hit neutral in turn; Casters are perhaps a bit [squishier](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard) than other classes, but that's it. Ironically, it's Riders who get to walk all over Casters, dealing double damage to them and taking half, probably as a call-back to various moments in *[Fate/stay night](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight)* and *[Fate/Zero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero)*.
				- [Herd-Hitting Attack](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Of all the classes with offensive based Noble Phantasms, offensive-based Casters with damaging Noble Phantasms are more likely to have AoE Noble Phantasms that hit multiple foes. Even Servants that only debuff enemies (i.e. El-Melloi II and Amadeus) have Noble Phantasms that debuff multiple enemies on field.
				- [Limit Break](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Casters typically have three Arts cards (and never less than two) & a naturally high charge rate for their Noble Phantasm gauge, meaning that they can use them frequently.
				- [Squishy Wizard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Gameplay and lore-wise, most of the Casters tend to have very low durability, most usually have E or D rank on Endurance as the highest, although it should be noted that their Endurance is not as bad when compared to Assassins for the matter
						- Charles Babbage and Thomas Alva Edison are the only exceptions to this rule in both gameplay and lore-wise, as their Endurance stats are ranked B++ and EX respectively, though Edison's is misleading and effectively much lower.
					- They also tend to have lower base stats than usual compared to classes like the Saber.
				- [Stone Wall](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A very large amount of Casters tend to have above average HP (with Charles Babbage even having the highest HP out of all three-star servants) but middling to average ATK, which, coupled with their 0.9x damage modifier, hurts their offensive potential considerably, but makes them pretty decent for soaking up hits from enemies.
					- Xuanzang Sanzang, Izumo-no-Okuni, Murasaki Shikibu are the only exception to this trope, having the highest ATK, second highest and third highest ATK respectively out of all Casters, but even they pale in comparison to the other classes with the highest ATK.
				- [Support Party Member](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Most of the game's best supports are in this Class.
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Casters have an advantage against Assassins and a weakness against Riders.
					- They also have the common strength and weakness against Berserkers, offensive disadvantage against Rulers, as well as an offensive advantage against Demon Pillars/Beast I, defensive disadvantage against Alter Ego (like other of the Four Cavalry classes), and defensive advantage against Pretenders.
			- **Misc**
				- [Wizard Classic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Their class card depicts an enrobed sorcerer with a long beard holding a staff and grimoire.
	- ### [[Assassin]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
		  collapsed:: true
			- Within certain Holy Grail War structures, the only qualifying Heroic Spirits are the nineteen Hassan-i-Sabbah due to the etymology of the very word Assassin being tied to them
				- Within the Fuyuki Holy Grail War, it is said to be fixed in the system itself that Hassan will always be summoned, but there is a small chance, so low as to be considered nonexistent, that another will answer the summons.
					- The existence of Sasaki Kojiro is an abberation within that system due to his unique circumstances
				- Within the world of *Fate/Apocrypha*, the Subcategory Holy Grail War led to a proliferation in the number of Hassans summoned, a "golden era" where Assassins were a great menace because, on top of their mana consumption being low, killing Masters was far easier than battles between Servants
					- However, this resulted in all of their True Names and Noble Phantasms being documented, and countermeasures against them were taken, causing the Hassan boom to fall into decline.
					- Masters eventually began adding additional lines to the summoning incantations and bringing catalysts not associated with Hassan to call upon different Heroic Spirits
				- For the Hassan-i-Sabbah, they lack glamorous legends, so they are known to possess low attributes.
					- Their very lifeline in battle is reliance on Presence Concealment
			- Within other systems, there is no limit on the summoning of other Heroic Spirits
		- #### Skills, and Characteristics
		  collapsed:: true
			- Servants of this class are skilled at operating covertly, stealthy, and silently
			- This class is one of the weaker classes at fighting, as its members possess low attributes due to not having glorious legends as heroes, so it instead specializes in killing Masters rather than Servants
			- It is an oddity compared to the more formal knight classes who believe in fair duels and chivalry in combat
				- They will attack using the most unfair and favorable conditions, and with these conditions, it is possible for an Assassin to match and defeat other Servants.
			- Class Skills
				- Presence Concealment — allows them to remain undetected when spying or preparing to ambush their targets.
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
				- [Hitman with a Heart](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitmanWithAHeart):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Despite having the unflattering distinction of being called the "Heroic Spirits of Murder/Assassination", many of the Assassins are actually [quite affable while off the clock](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain) or even be well-intentioned if not outright nice people.
					- Some notable examples include dorky [Ninja](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja) Fuuma Kotarou and the unflinchingly virtuous Hassan of the Cursed Arm.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A number of Assassin Servants are either:
						- a) a member of [The Hashshashin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin), who are the [Trope Namer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer);
						- b) a Japanese [samurai](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai), [Ninja](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja), martial artist or mythological figure who is likely a [Fragile Speedster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster);
						- c) a Chinese historical figure/martial artist [involved in the chaos](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing) [of their history](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors). They also tend to be the most numerous out of these particular grouping.
					- At least within the early days of FGO, they tend to have 3 Quick cards, which, when combined with their Presence Concealment passive, allow them to gain a lot of Critical Stars in one go.
						- These days, assassins have more of a variety of card decks, but with the exceptions of First Hassan, Semiramis, Li Shuwen, Tezcatlipoca, and Locusta, all of them still have at least two quick cards within their deck.
				- [Professional Killer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The Hashashin are a clan of eclectic, but ultimately reliable hitmen.
					- Many of the other Assassins in the game are martial artists who simply want opportunities to refine or show off their killing techniques.
				- [Psycho for Hire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The rest of them are either mentally unbalanced or outright sadists who revel in creating pain and havoc.
			- **Abilities**
				- [Combat Pragmatist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist):
				  collapsed:: true
					- For the most part, this class is not expected to engage in any form of [gentlemanly warfare](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen)—except maybe some of the martial artists (and the supernaturally-powered ones).
					- If it can kill their opponent efficiently (or can cause the most pain), then an Assassin can be expected to use it, no questions asked.
						- Considering their usually-low parameters, it's really the only way they are expected to gain an edge.
				- [Gameplay and Story Integration](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration):
				  collapsed:: true
					- More often than not, Assassin Class Noble Phantasms are high-damage single-target attacks, with only a handful of area attack NPs
					- Fitting for the idea as a single-target killer.
				- [Non-Indicative Name](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Some of the Assassin Servants are not really assassins or something similar, with some of them being defined by efficient killing methods and others by general sneakiness.
					- [Youkai](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai) and other "ghostly" characters also can be Assassins by virtue of them "haunting" a place.
				- [Stealth Expert](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The whole point of the "Presence Concealment" ability, which allows the Assassin class to remain undetected when spying or preparing an ambush.
					- In *GO*, it translates into a better chance to drop Critical Stars, as actual stealth has little bearing on gameplay.
					- The game is a little shaky when it comes to tying gameplay to lore, but the implicationnote  seems to be that Presence Concealment -> Getting the first strike -> More likely to create an opening -> More likely to get in a critical/powerful blow.
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Critical Hit Class](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Most Assassin Servants have *some* aspect manipulating Critical Strength or Critical Star Drop Rates to increase the chance of Critical Hits in the first place.
					- Namely, their Passive Class Skill Presence Concealment increases their Critical Star Drop Rate.
					- Some Servants have card decks that help them with Critical Hits even despite no other skills supporting them, namely a Quick Brave Chain to generate 10 Stars for the next turn.
				- [Gameplay and Story Segregation](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Assassin is the class for people like assassins, murderers, executioners and tyrants.
						- Basically, they kill people who can't fight back.
					- However, many large monsters are categorized as Rider class enemies, meaning little girls who are about four and a half feet tall can tear up dragons a thousand times their size with little knives while famous dragon slayers like Siegfried (a Saber) and Saint George (a Rider) struggle to deal with them due to the classes not matching up right.
				- [Highly-Visible Ninja](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja):
				  collapsed:: true
					- King Hassan has A-ranked Presence Concealment despite being a giant in armor covered with flaming skulls, and Cleopatra moonwalks and throws out sparkles every time she attacks, yet still has the skill at B-rank.
					- Apparently it doesn't really matter how you dress or behave.
				- [Out of Focus](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Suffered from this for a while; at launch, there were no five-star Assassins at all, and only two four-stars.
						- Even today, they don't tend to have many strong representatives compared to the other regular classes.
					- There was even basically a drought of Assassin Servants, as there was *over a year and a half* gap between Okita J. Souji and Kiichi Hougen, and after Kama was released, it took about *two and a half* years for another five-star assassin (Koyanskaya of Light) to be released.
				- [Rare Random Drop](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop):
				  collapsed:: true
					- For a long time, Jack the Ripper, the game's first 5* Assassin, was the only available 5* Assassin in the permanent pool.
					- It took almost two years to have another 5* Assassin released for the permanent pool (Osakabehime).
					- Li Shuwen is story-locked and every other 5* Assassin is limited.
				- [Stone Wall](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Contrasting what you might expect from the class title, Assassins actually tend to have a low attack stat which is reduced further by a hidden 0.9 multiplier, meaning their damage is unlikely to be very high apart from very specific situations, such as Jack vs female Servants or Kama vs Alter Egos.
					- On the other hand, they're often quite bulky with good self healing and damage mitigation.
						- Cleopatra and King Hassan, for example, are capable of soloing some difficult challenge quests.
					- Their class is also helpful in terms of the class triangle: Caster enemies aren't very common, but Riders are, giving them a helpful niche.
					- For the enemy party is reverses: Only a few Casters are good offensively and Assassin enemies are quick to reach full NP, meaning they can cause long difficult fights.
						- As a result, Assassin class bosses tend to be some of the most annoying in the game, perhaps surpassed only by the likes of Alter Egos, which have an offensive advantage against the common support classes *and* their only defensive counter.
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Assassins have an advantage against Riders and a weakness against Casters.
					- They also have the common strength and weakness against Berserkers and resistance from Rulers, as well as an offensive advantage against Demon God Pillars and the general Four Cavalry Class weakness when dealing with Alter Egos.
			- **Misc**
				- [Skull for a Head](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkullForAHead):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Their class card depicts a heavily emaciated assassin wearing a skull mask. 
					  This is because the class itself was originally only intended to summon one of the nineteen Hassan-i-Sabbah.
	- ### [[Berserker]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Qualifications
		  collapsed:: true
			- Servants placed within this Class are always Heroic Spirits who have gone berserk during battle at least once in their lifetime.
				- This trait allows them to use the special ability Mad Enhancement, which trades their consciousness and sanity for a large power boost.
			- This Class is usually for magi who have summoned Heroic Spirits with insufficient abilities and attributes, allowing them to strengthen their Servants to make up for their lower attributes and compete against stronger opponents.
				- While it is ideal for Servants to reach the level of the Heroic Spirit, the Class allows for their attributes to surpass even the original.
				- If used on an already strong Heroic Spirit, such as Heracles, they will become empowered to truly extraordinary levels.
				- The abuse of this to create powerful Servants has made the Class referred to as the strongest of all seven classes
			- It is possible to specify in the summoning ritual that the Servant be placed under the Berserker Class for those familiar with the workings of the Grail System.
				- By adding in a specific line, Zouken Matou and the Einzbern family, as members of the Three Founding Families, were able to choose the Class during the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars respectively.
				- This Class comes at a price, as the Berserker Class is the most difficult to control and a Master must expend a large amount of additional magical energy merely to maintain the Berserker
					- The affected Heroic Spirit may lose access to certain abilities or even Noble Phantasms depending on how much sanity it has taken away for power.
		- #### Skills and Characteristics
		  collapsed:: true
			- Masters are unable to utilize coordination with their Servant unless gifted with superb control over them.
				- The lack of complex rational thinking keeps them from being able to follow more than simple directions, and it may even require Command Spells to keep them from acting on their own.
				- They generally rely on little other than brute strength and overwhelming, uncontrolled strikes to physically beat down their opponents.
			- As a result, in every Holy Grail War before the Fifth, the magical energy consumption and insanity of the Berserker Class has made them incredibly difficult to maintain and control.
				- Kariya Matou is drained of his energy at a high rate and eventually it causes his death, but he could have handled another Class without difficulty.
				- They have generally brought about their own Master's ruin due to their 
				  inability to control them, so the Einzbern family developed Ilyasviel's Magic Circuits specifically so that she could handle the strain with ease in the Fifth Holy Grail War
		- #### Shared Tropes
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Personality**
				- [The Artifact](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Berserkers incapable of speech such as Heracles, Lu Bu, and Darius III.
						- After launch, most of the game's Berserkers, even those with really high Mad Enhancement, can talk (although they still have a tendency to be really aggressive or loony when they do) because the format of the game makes characterizing people who can't talk *very* difficult.
						- Newer Berserkers can talk simply to ensure they can get characterization and meaningful interactions with others.
					- The Mad Enhancement trait itself used to be the defining element of the Berserker class, and exclusive to them.
						- In *Grand Order* it can be found in other Servants whose legends mention mental health problems, while those in the proper Berserker class lean more towards [Insane Equals Violent](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent).
				- [Blood Knight](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The saner (relative to the class) examples tend to be this.
				- [Dying as Yourself](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Usually, in between a deathblow being struck and the Berserker dissipating completely, Madness Enhancement wears off, and the Servant has a few moments of clarity and sanity.
				- [Logical Weakness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Berserkers are defined by both their madness and how they gave into it for power.
					- Thus, who better to face them than Foreigners, who not only gained power from contacting mind-rending eldritch horrors but *overcame* the insanity to bring out their full power?
				- [Mask of Sanity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskOfSanity):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Berserkers with very high or very low Mad Enhancement can appear lucid and even-keeled. Then a [Berserk Button](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton) is lightly tapped and they all but leap at the offending force in a violent rage.
				- [Planet of Hats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Many [Yandere](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere) characters tend to find themselves in this class (or at least qualified to be within this class as showcased with the Phantom of the Opera who is not a *playable* Berserker servant, but he's actually fought in this class in the Shinjuku singularity) due to their love for somebody being able to make them quite crazy.
					- Because of their Mad Enhancement passive skill as well as the fact that [many Berserker servants need to have a command spell be used on them to activate their more complicated Noble Phantasms](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration), a lot of Berserker servants tend to have a triple Buster deck.
				- [Tragic Monster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Berserkers got the short end of the stick in regards to being slaves to their legend.
					- It's a common theme for Servants to have learned from their past mistakes and strive not to repeat them in the modern era, but for Berserkers these mistakes that drove them to madness are often the very thing that made them a Heroic Spirit in the first place.
					- Because a Berserker's legend is built off of their madness, they *cannot* get better, and attempting to defy their legend will damage or even destroy their Saint Graph.
						- This is why they're one of the riskiest Servants for a Master to handle, as it doesn't matter how much rapport or trust they build: once their [Berserk Button](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton) is pressed, all bets are off.
				- [Unstoppable Rage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The stereotypical form of Mad Enhancement, where a Servant is empowered but made less controllable by their insane, frothing anger.
					- Some Berserkers have quite different forms of mental illness, but this is the most common (hence the class name).
			- **Abilities**
				- [The Berserker](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Being summoned with the "Mad Enhancement" class skill — especially at higher levels — robs them of their ability for rational thought and limits their ability to effectively use their Noble Phantasms, but greatly boosts their physical parameters.
					- The majority of them have very aggressive BBBQA decks as a result, showing a total focus on offense but finding it difficult to use smaller, more controlled attacks.
					- It also makes it very difficult for them to fill their Noble Phantasm gauge and even use it once, often requiring external aid such as a Craft Essence or even a Command Spell
						- mirrors how Berserkers in other works need Command Spells to use their more complicated Noble Phantasms.
				- [Brutish Character, Brutish Weapon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutishCharacterBrutishWeapon):
				  collapsed:: true
					- A good majority of Berserkers favor big and bulky weapons like battle-axes, warhammers, maces, and the occasional [BFS](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS), to represent their immense strength and straightforward brutish fighting styles.
				- [The Mentally Disturbed](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentallyDisturbed):
				  collapsed:: true
					- While being a powerful warrior is also useful, being famous for your severe mental illness is the only criterion you need to be summoned as a Berserker
					- Everything from explosive rage disorder to chronic depression will work just fine.
				- [Power Born of Madness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The effect of their Class Skill, [Mad Enhancement](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker), takes away their reasoning and in exchange boosts their stats.
					- At the lowest ranks it doesn't really do much either way, but by D Servants like Frankenstein start finding it difficult to speak even if they're rational and C-A are often just completely crazed warriors.
					- However, once you get up to EX you reach a point where you can speak to the Servant and be understood, but cannot hope to reach any real understanding.
					- However, several of the Servants who qualify for classes other than Berserker imply that the tradeoff is generally not worth it.
					- Apart from being mana hogs, Herakles can't display his fighting techniques, Noble Phantasms or cunning, Lancelot loses a Noble Phantasm and a great deal of flexibility in exchange for a meager stat boost while Lu Bu can only use part of his very versatile Noble Phantasm.
				- [Screaming Warrior](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingWarrior):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Heracles and Lu Bu are never seen speaking while Lancelot struggles to say more than 'Arthur' or 'Galahad'.
					- Darius is almost the same, occasionally screaming 'Iskandar', but he also has his very rare moments of simplified speech.
					- Eric and Caligula are capable of speaking normally on occasion, but generally don't.
					- Finally, Asterios and Fran are perfectly capable of speaking, but they don't sound very used to it and generally just choose to roar and scream during combat and make mumbling noises outside of it.
					- As for the rest, a few like Ibaraki or Beowulf are almost entirely rational while the likes of Nightingale or Kiyohime can speak coherently even while fighting because their madness isn't associated with fighting.
				- [Unskilled, but Strong](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong):
				  collapsed:: true
					- One of the things that usually vanishes along with a Berserker's sanity is their motor skills.
						- This results in their skill with a weapon being reduced to "smash the opponent to bits with wild swings", with technique almost becoming non-existent.
					- In-game, this is represented with the bulk of Berserkers [having a QABBB Command Deck and a low critical star weight](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats)
						- With three Buster cards at their disposal, they can deal a lot of direct damage with normal attacks, but have difficulty building up both critical stars and Noble Phantasm gauges.
						- However, a few Berserkers do have a QAABB or even QQABB deck. These tend to be the more apparently rational Berserkers, though they're often very mentally ill.
					- In some cases this is a double-edged sword, as they lose any skills and knowledge they may have had in return for brute strength.
						- Lancelot was a heroic knight renowned for his nearly superhuman skill at arms.
						- Lu Bu was an unsurpassed equestrian, spearman, and archer.
						- Heracles fits the parameters for *every* base class except Caster, yet Berserker is canonically his *weakest* possible incarnation, as he loses his vast martial mastery and famous cunning in exchange for more of something he already has plenty of (physical strength).
					- Averted if they possess Mental Pollution.
						- This blocks out the negatives of Mad Enhancement while keeping all of the perks, and it's not for nothing that such characters are considered terrifying to face.
						- The catch is that they tend to be loopy for [different](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality) [reasons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander).
			- **Gameplay**
				- [Difficult, but Awesome](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In the early days of the game, deploying an all-Berserker team normally guarantees you will be able to cause super-effective damage to all of your enemies.
					- This changed come the advent of higher-leveled enemies plus more specialized battle challenges, nearly relegating the entire class into [Crutch Character](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter).
					- However, well-planned playstyles (especially if they are built specifically to the strengths of a centerpiece Berserker Servant) can guarantee that they will not only live, but also deal as much damage as possible to enemies
					- even in comparison to some specialized team compositions designed along expected [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors) lines (especially in several challenge quests that involve [facing multiple bosses](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush) with different variety of classes, which AoE Berserkers like Chacha and Raiko comes into play).
					- The catch, however, is that the moment the Berserker Servant is taken out anyway, [the entire team may fall apart](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy)/have difficulty lasting out your enemies.

					- They're semi-super-effective (150% damage) against every other class in the game outside of Shielder and Foreigner, but to compensate, they also take full super-effective damage from all of them.
						- NPC Berserkers "compensate" for this with above-average HP, but player ones tend to have standard or even low HP totals for their rarity.
					- This leads to Cú Chulainn Alter and Heracles being particularly prized by some because their skills and high raw stats allow them compensate for their class' fragility.
						- Heracles in particular is considered by many to be the best Berserker in the game *because* of his ability to avert this so hard.
						- To the point he can *solo the final boss of the story on his own with the right setup.*
					- This trope is especially true in *FGO Arcade*. The PvP nature of this game displays the strength and weakness of the class perfectly.
						- Since the Servants' HP aren't that high, Berserkers only need a few hits to defeat their opponents,
						- But on the flip side, Berserkers tend to die quickly for the same reason.
				- [Nerf](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf):
				  collapsed:: true
					- The introduction of the Foreigner class serves as this, since not only do Berserkers not do 150% damage to them like they do against all other summonable Servants, but they are, in fact, *reduced to dealing 50% damage* instead, with exactly the same (relative) fragility as they have against everything else.
					- This makes nodes with strong Berserkers far easier, since players don't have to worry as much about only having one Servant that the enemy can't just one-shot with a casual Buster attack, making their frequently absurdly-inflated HP the only real issue with taking them down.
				- [Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors):
				  collapsed:: true
					- In terms of the game, Berserkers have an [offensive advantage and defensive weakness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon) against every other playable class except Shielder, who is neutral to every other class, and Foreigner, which is a genuine counter to Berserkers.
			- **Misc**
				- [Beast Man](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan):
				  collapsed:: true
					- Their class card depicts a hulking and bestial-looking warrior wielding a massive cleaver.
				- [Evil Makes You Ugly](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouUgly):
				  collapsed:: true
					- "Evil" is a bit of a stretch, but it's common for Berserkers with intense Madness Enhancement to have it distort their bodies.
					- Heracles's barely-human appearance and Darius being a towering, obsidian colossus are both the result of Madness Enhancement.
						- Also, under his helmet, Lancelot has teeth like a shark.
				- [Muscles Are Meaningless](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless):
				  collapsed:: true
					- While at the beginning of the game most Berserkers were big burly men, nowadays most of them are beautiful women with no visible musculature, with the sole exception being Penthesilea.
- ## Summoning Information
	- ### Catalysts
		- Symbols and holy relics used to attract the desired Heroic Spirit
		- Require something with a connection to the hero, it can be anything from a sword, armor, a talisman, or even their bones
		- If the catalyst is one that is particularly weak, or if it is one with a connection to many different Heroic Spirits, the Heroic Spirit among the candidates that has good affinity with the Master will be chosen
		- Should the summoner lack a catalyst entirely, then the summoner acts as the catalyst themselves
		- Some are those that have only been connected to a single Heroic Spirit, allowing them to be brought forth regardless of affinity with the Master
		- In a rare case, EMIYA's catalyst is not the pendant Rin Tohsaka owns in the present. EMIYA is instead a case where he holds a catalyst with a connection to his summoner
- ## Servant Skills
	- The embodiment of a Servant's various abilities and characteristics. They are divided into two main categories:
		- Class Skills, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class
		- Personal Skills, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves
	- ### Class Skills
		- Magic Resistance
		  id:: 6681c23f-c7d4-4de0-8e09-15af4c3941cc

			- [Magic Resistance](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Resistance) (Type-Moon Wiki)

		- Riding

			- [Riding](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Riding) (Type-Moon Wiki)

		- Independent Action
			- The ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one's Master.
			- Allows for action even in the absence of the Master.
			- It is both useful and troublesome depending on the disposition of the Servant and the rank of skill
			- Acting in autonomy from the Master's Magical Energy supply, the Master can concentrate their own Magical 
			  Energy on large spells, or the Servant will be fine even in the case the Master cannot supply Magical Energy due to injury
				- The downside is that they can be harder to control and keep by their side, making the only true way to command them is by utilizing Command Spells
			- Allows them the ability to act independently for a length of time without an active supply of magical energy from their Master
				- For Archers with high ranked Independent Action and a disposition opposite to the Master, the only guaranteed way to control them is through the use of Command Spells.
