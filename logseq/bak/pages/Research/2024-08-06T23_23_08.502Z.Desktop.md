- ## Abstracts and Short Descriptions
	- ### Abstracts
	  collapsed:: true
		- An abstract is a short summary of a research paper
			- Usually about a paragraph (roughly 6-7 sentences, or 150-250 words) long
			- Serves multiple purposes
				- Gives the gist of the paper or article quickly so they can decide whether or not to read the full paper or article
				- Prepares readers to follow detailed information, analyses, and arguments in the full paper article
				- Helps readers remember key points from the paper or article
				- Used to identify key terms for indexing published papers
			- Should be intelligible on its own without the reader having to read the entire article
			  collapsed:: true
				- You don't usually cite references in the abstract
					- An abstract is a description of what you studied, what you found, and what you argue in the paper or article
				- References are cited in the body of the paper

					- Main reasons, rationale, and/or goals for your research

	- ### Short Descriptions
	  collapsed:: true
		- A concise explanation of the scope of the page
		- Purpose
			- A very brief indication of the field covered by the article
			- A short descriptive annotation
			- A disambiguation in searches, especially to distinguish the subject from similarly titled subjects in different fields
		- Content
			- Meant to distinguish an article from similarly named articles in search results, and not to define the subject
			- Each description should provide
				- A brief overview of the topic
				- A short annotation
				- A way to differentiate it from other similarly titled articles
			- Content text
				- A short description is not a definition
					- Editors should not attempt to define the article's subject nor to summarise the lead
				- A good short description should:
					- Focus on the purposes stated above
					- Start with the most important information
					- Use universally accepted facts that will not be subject to rapid change,
						- Avoiding anything that could be understood as controversial, judgmental, or promotional
					- Avoid jargon, and use simple, readily comprehensible terms that do not require pre-existing detailed knowledge of the subject
					- Avoid duplicating information that is already in the title
						- Don't worry too much if you need to repeat a word or two for context
					- Avoid time-specific adjectives
						- Like: "former", "retired", "late", "defunct", "closed", "current", "new", "recent", "planned", "future", etc.
					- Avoid subjective adjectives
						- Like: "small", "famous", "popular"
			- Formatting
				- Each short description should:
					- Be written in plain text – without HTML tags, wiki markup, typographic dingbats, emojis, or CSS display manipulation
					- Start with a capital letter
					- Avoid initial articles (A, An, The) except when required for correct grammar and meaning
					- Avoid using a final full stop (period)
					- Be short – no longer than is needed to fulfill its purposes effectively
						- More than 80% of short descriptions use fewer than 40 characters (including spaces)
						- Fewer than 3% of short descriptions are longer than 60 characters, and short descriptions longer than 100 characters will be flagged for attention
						- Because they are intended to be scanned quickly, longer, more specific descriptions can be less useful.
			- Examples
				- A good way to draft a short description is to consider the words that would naturally follow if you started a sentence like this:
					- "**[Article subject] is/was a/an/the ... **".
					- Use those additional words as the short description.
						- Example: "Stève Nzigamasabo is a *Burundian footballer*"
							- *Burundian footballer* becomes the short description
				- List of examples
					- For a person: "[country adjective] [what the person is known for]" (Examples: "American singer/songwriter" or "Cuban ice skater")
					- For a location: "[type of location], [country]" (Examples: "City in Florida, United States" or "University in Oxford, England")
					- For an organism: "[type of organism] [how it is best known]" (Examples: "Species of moth", "Species of monkey", "Extinct group of molluscs")
						- Do not include family or other technical taxonomic terms
					- Publication: "[year] [type of publication] by [author or director]" (Examples: "1983 novel by John Irving", "2017 film by Jordan Peele")
					- Miscellaneous: "Type of [noun]", "Concept in [academic field]"
