## Short Description
	- [[Marshall D. Teach]] and [[Rocks D. Xebec]]
	- Summary
- Their whole garbage
	- Guy who wants to be king of the pirates at any cost and his new best friend, guy who wants to be king of the world at any cost
	- Team Rider is one of, if not *the* biggest threat in this grail war
		- The other biggest threat is team berserker lol
		- These guys are such a fucking problem for everybody
		- An extremely fucking terrifying as as a master/servant combo. Just like bad news all around
	- Team Rider is already a huge problem. The only thing keeping them from being an apocalyptic-level threat is that they are seconds away from just fucking killing each other
		- The cunts are conspiring [against each other], my liege
		- Thank god they're infighting otherwise we'd all be screwed
			- Clash of egos
			- Blackbeard is the king of biding his time and waiting for his moment, and Xebec is king of fuck it we ball
			- Xebec does NOT want to listen to blackbeard. The only thing keeping his ass in line is the command spells and he is constantly testing blackbeards patience
		- I think xebec is conspiring to kill blackbeard behind his back
			- maybe blackbeard ends up having to order xebec by command seal to kill himself
			- maybe xebec is manipulating events so blackbeard has to use command spells so that he can be free of blackbeard, fucking kill him, and take the grail for himself
		- I gotta look into what makes blackbeard captain. Why do all those criminals follow him anyway?
			- Do you think Xebec would follow him also? My guess is no way in hell
			- I think hes trying to steal blackbeards crew out from under him and do whatever the fuck he wants
				- I should look into those guys
