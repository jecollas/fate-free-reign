		- Ace mainly uses his flames for a different kinds of offensive attacks that can create and unleash massive amounts of fire for large-scale damage as well as small precision attacks
	- **List of Techniques**
		- **Fire Fist** (Hiken) – turns his fist into fire and launches it as a massive column of flame at his target powerful enough to destroy ships and annihilate entire cities at once
		  id:: 8ffa9b07-36e0-4841-a99b-afa2d7a5b384
			- Ace's signature attack, and the reason why he's called "Fire Fist Ace"
		- **Heat Haze** (Kagero) – shoots a stream of fire from the palm of his hand
		- **Flame Fence** (Enjomo) – creates a circle of fire around a selected area to prevent anyone from leaving or entering
		- **Fire Gun** (Higan) – points the index and middle fingers of both hands at an opponent, turns his fingertips into fire, and shoots bullets of compressed flame at them
			- Literal finger guns lol
		- **Flame Commandment** (Enkai) – amasses a large amount of flames around his body to prepare for another attack
			- Usually does this by swinging his outstretched hand in a circle to "summon" a swirling ball of flames
			- **Fire Pillar** (Hibashira) – shoots the collected flames straight upward to destroy at a target above him, or downwards to get rid of any enemies below him while he's in mid-air
		- **Firefly** (Hotarubi) – creates a swarm of small, glowing fireballs that float around an enemy to prepare for another attack
			- The fireballs are greenish-yellow and look like fireflies
			- **Fiery Doll** (Hidaruma) – sends the fireflies flying into his targets all at once and burns them
			- **Fire Whirl** (Kasen) – shoots the fireflies at his targets at high speed to distract them and cause them to scatter
			- **Ship Spirit** (Funadama) – instead of firing them all at once, he staggers the timing and uses Observation Haki to place them where his targets are going to be before setting them off
		- **St. Elmo's Fire** (Shinka: Shiranui) – hurls long lances made out of fire, which has the combined effect of piercing and burning a target at the same time
