description:: what is this thang anyway

- The [[Throne of Heroes]] is a collective of powerful historical and 
  mythological champions who are meant to be used as agents or Familiars in service of protecting mankind.
	- Here, the architects of the Fuyuki Holy Grail War intended for them to be used as little more than supercharged human sacrifices.
- There exists a plane outside of human concepts, within which lies the Throne of Heroes.
	- Here, the records of the brave men and women whose lives have become legends are kept, to be used as eternal guardians of mankind.
	- When a legend has been venerated enough by humanity, it can become immortalized as a Heroic Spirit that surpasses time itself.
	- However, the definition of what a "hero" is, is broad; even the ruthless and heartless are the heroes of their own tales
- Heroic Spirits are freed from the constraints of time itself and removed from the ring of reincarnation, moved to the **Throne of Heroes**, a place existing outside of both the World and the time axis. The Throne of Heroes is also occasionally referred to as the **Ring of Deterrence**, referring to how it is mainly used by the Counter Force.
