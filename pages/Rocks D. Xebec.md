		- Although Rocks' individual strength and abilities are unknown, he was well-reputed for presiding over a crew of extremely powerful pirates with clashing personalities and a lack of camaraderie, indicating that he was an extremely powerful and charismatic individual.
		- Aside from raw strength, Rocks seemed to be a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, as, through studying many subjects that were considered taboo, he was able to unravel many of the World Government's secrets, which led the Government to decide to erase his name from history following his defeat.

- Summoning info
	- I think that bc Xebec’s story has been so bonked from history, the version of him recorded in the throne of heroes and summoned is an absolutely keyed up version of the guy. Hes a loose fucking cannon and he might as well be a berserker for how goddamn off the wall he is.
- Shit from the fanwiki
  collapsed:: true
	- Enemies (World Government)
		- Rocks' actions were destructive and anarchic enough that the Government considered him akin to a terrorist, meaning many of his feats were not properly recorded in history, causing Rocks to eventually fade from public consciousness save the memory of some veteran Marines and the former members of his crew.
	- Legacy
		- Many of Rocks' subordinates would go on to become extremely notable pirates, particularly Edward Newgate, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou, who became three of the Four Emperors ruling over the New World. Shiki infamously clashed with the Roger Pirates multiple times and became the first documented inmate to escape Impel Down, while Captain John gathered a fabled treasure that's been sought for decades.
		- Rocks' place in history has been considerably diminished in the decades since his death, with many younger Marines being unaware of who he is. According to Sengoku, this lack of knowledge about him is mainly due to the World Government's intervention, as his path resulted in him dabbling in subjects they forbid.
		- Additionally, due to the overall lack of camaraderie within the Rocks Pirates, most of Rocks' past subordinates are not inclined to talk about their time sailing with the crew.
		- Rocks' dream of taking over the world would be revived 38 years after his death, as his former subordinates Kaidou and Linlin decided to put aside their enmity with each other and form a temporary alliance to conquer the world. This revived dream ultimately and quickly fell apart when both Linlin and Kaidou were defeated and eventually replaced as Emperors. In a twist of fate, the one to personally defeat Kaidou was Garp's grandson, Monkey D. Luffy
