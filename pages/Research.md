		- An abstract is a short summary of a research paper
			- Usually about a paragraph (roughly 6-7 sentences, or 150-250 words) long
			- Serves multiple purposes
				- Gives the gist of the paper or article quickly so they can decide whether or not to read the full paper or article
				- Prepares readers to follow detailed information, analyses, and arguments in the full paper article
				- Helps readers remember key points from the paper or article
				- Used to identify key terms for indexing published papers
			- Should be intelligible on its own without the reader having to read the entire article
			  collapsed:: true

	- ### Short Descriptions
	  collapsed:: true
		- A concise explanation of the scope of the page
			- Provides a brief overview of the topic, a short annotation, and a way to differentiate the page from other similarly titled articles
			- Meant to be scanned quickly
			- Not a definition of the subject, or a summary of the lead section
		- Content to include
			- Start with the most important information about the subject
			- Use universally accepted facts not subject to rapid change
			- Use simple terms that don't require pre-existing detailed knowledge about the subject (i.e., any technical jargon)
		- Content to avoid
			- Anything that could be understood as controversial, judgmental, or promotional
			- Repeating information already in the title
			- Time-specific or subjective adjectives
				- Former, retired, late, defunct, closed, current, new, recent, planned, future, etc.
				- Small, famous, popular, etc.
		- Formatting
			- Use plain text (no HTML tags, markdown, emojis, etc.)
			- Start with a capital letter
			- Don't use initial articles (A, An, The) unless absolutely necessary
			- Avoid using a period at the end of the description
			- Be short (40 characters or less)
				- No longer than is needed to fulfill its purposes effectively
		- A good way to draft a short description is to consider the words that would naturally follow if you started a sentence like this:
			- "*[Article subject] is/was a/an/the ...*"
			- Use those additional words as the short description.
			- Example: "Stève Nzigamasabo is a *Burundian footballer*"
				- *Burundian footballer* becomes the short description
		- List of examples
			- For a person: "[country adjective] [what the person is known for]" (Examples: "American singer/songwriter" or "Cuban ice skater")
			- For a location: "[type of location], [country]" (Examples: "City in Florida, United States" or "University in Oxford, England")
			- For an organism: "[type of organism] [how it is best known]" (Examples: "Species of moth", "Species of monkey", "Extinct group of molluscs")
				- Do not include family or other technical taxonomic terms
			- Publication: "[year] [type of publication] by [author or director]" (Examples: "1983 novel by John Irving", "2017 film by Jordan Peele")
			- Miscellaneous: "Type of [noun]", "Concept in [academic field]"
	- ### Lead Section
		- The **lead section** is an introduction to an article and a summary of its most important contents
			- Located at the beginning of the article, before the table of contents and the first heading
			- Gives the basics in a nutshell and cultivates interest in reading on—though not by teasing the reader or hinting at what follows
			- Should be written in a clear, accessible style with a neutral point of view
		- The lead should stand on its own as a concise overview of the article's topic
			- It should identify the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies
			- As in the body of the article itself, the emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic
			- Apart from basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article.
		- As a general rule of thumb, a lead section should contain no more than four well-composed paragraphs and be carefully sourced as appropriate, although it is common for citations to appear in the body and not the lead.
