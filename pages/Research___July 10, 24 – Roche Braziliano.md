		- Section: Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin, De Americaensche zee-roovers. Amsterdam: Jan ten Hoorn, 1678
		- “Exquemelin had painted an often grim and critical picture of the dealings of the French and English buccaneers. He was especially critical of Henry Morgan’s attack on Panama (1669) and accused him of stealing from his men. In the first English translation, the tone of the account changed radically: Morgan was transformed from a villain to the central hero of the story.”
