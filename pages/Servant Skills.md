- The embodiment of a Servant's various abilities and characteristics. They are divided into two main categories:
	- Class Skills, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class
	- Personal Skills, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves
- ## Class Skills
	- Magic Resistance

	  id:: 670706db-41fe-44a7-8636-5cbe4d0f0c7a
	  collapsed:: true
		- The ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one's Master.
		- Allows for action even in the absence of the Master.
		- It is both useful and troublesome depending on the disposition of the Servant and the rank of skill
		- Acting in autonomy from the Master's Magical Energy supply, the Master can concentrate their own Magical 
		  Energy on large spells, or the Servant will be fine even in the case the Master cannot supply Magical Energy due to injury
			- The downside is that they can be harder to control and keep by their side, making the only true way to command them is by utilizing Command Spells
		- Allows them the ability to act independently for a length of time without an active supply of magical energy from their Master
			- For Archers with high ranked Independent Action and a disposition opposite to the Master, the only guaranteed way to control them is through the use of Command Spells.
