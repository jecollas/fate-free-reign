			- Very closely tied to Sabo’s true home (Dawn Island)

		- [[Sabo]]
			- [swagever dude]([[Freak Dynamics/MS/Sabo and Ace]])
			- Ace's sworn brother in life, and his Master in death.

			- If anyone else had tried summoning him Ace wouldve been called forth as an archer. But it wasnt anyone else — it was sabo
		- [[Marshall D. Teach]]
			- [alexa kill this clown]([[Freak Dynamics/MvS/Teach and Ace]])
			- Guy who got him killed he sucks lol

	- What happens to him in the story
	- Gay sex for one. Torment nexus for two

	- Sabo has the flame flame fruit so ace doesnt have access to his usual arsenal of fire-based archer attacks
		- Excluding his St. Elmo’s Fire weapon and Fire Fist noble phantasm
	- Some of his parameters as a lancer are weaker than the archer version, but his hand-to-hand combat is way better

	- ### Skills
		- #### Class Skills
			- ((6681c23f-c7d4-4de0-8e09-15af4c3941cc))
		- #### Personal Skills
			- ((67071685-8ba5-420c-a389-43a7a4847eef))
			- ((6707177d-8900-41f8-8738-46cb707e5aca))
	- ### [[Noble Phantasm]]
		- **Fire Fist**
			- Buster-type Single Target (Anti-Unit)
				- Buster-type AoE (Anti-Army)? Nah, this is the watered down version
			- ((8ffa9b07-36e0-4841-a99b-afa2d7a5b384))
			- Ace's signature attack, which would definitely give away his True Name if used
				- A fist can be a spear if you punch hard enough. If you turn your fist into flames and punch someone from far away I'm pretty sure that counts as a long-range melee weapon
			- Requires a lot more mana to use, so Ace doesn't use this one too often
		- **St. Elmo’s Fire**
			- Buster-type Single Target (Anti-Unit)
			- ((7c4cfa43-1ba6-463c-bced-1d61c0a2abd7))
			- Blast attack from the fire spear yeehaw
			- Based on the ((668f5f61-546f-45b6-9bf6-a7e7b9192b35))
				- I cant believe there exists a polearm thats a combination flamethrower/shotgun. Are you kidding me that’s fucking awesome
	- ### Combat
		- #### St. Elmo's Fire
			- Alternate names: St. Elmo’s Fire Spear, St. Elmo’s Spear, Divine Fire Fist, St. Elmo’s Fire, St. Elmo’s Fire Staff, St. Elmo's Beam
			- An amalgamation weapon that manifested upon Ace's summoning as a Lancer, based on various stories told about his strength in battle from around the world
				- **Grey Terminal** – Ace's favored weapon from childhood was a long metal pipe, which he used to rob and assault grown men in the Terminal and Edge Town
				- **The Grand Line** – stories about Ace's Devil Fruit abilities are infamous on the Grand Line. His St. Elmo's Fire technique may not be as well-known as his Fire Fist, but its power was just as feared
				- **Wano** – h eg ot it from wano idk man im eepyhonk shoo
					- It’s TOTALLY plausible for Ace to have gotten his hands on an ancient Fire Spear in Wano and absolutely wreck shop for the Beast Pirates
					- Ace was in Wano back when he was still captain of the Spade pirates and became beloved by everyone he met
					- Stories of him with a Fire Spear could come from Ace’s time in Wano
						- Fought against the Beast Pirates terrorizing Tama’s village in Kuri
					- Told with enough frequency that it could have been inscribed with him onto the Throne of Heroes
				- **The Whitebeard Pirates** – Ace may be younger, but his story is still closely associated with Whitebeard’s, and Ace is still his beloved son. Why shouldn’t he have a weapon similar to his father’s?
					- Whitebeard's naginata, Murakumogiri
			- A polearm that consists of a long bo staff made from a metal pipe topped with a wye joint, and powered by St. Elmo’s Fire
				- With the application of St. Elmo’s Fire (his devil fruit technique) he can create a brush of fire at the end of the pipe (in a similar way as St. Elmo’s Fire, the weather phenomena) in the shape of a blade
				- The joint at the end of the pipe is important because it points the direction where the St. Elmo’s Fire shoots out from to form the blade
				- Uurrrm.. it shoots fire out of the pipe. It can ignite into a blade, swoosh around, and ace can use a mana burst to make it go flamethrower mode yippeee

	- #### Weapons and Abilities
		- *Haki* – Ace can use all three types of Haki, but he rarely uses them for combat in favor of fighting with his Devil Fruit abilities
			- Ace's Haki is fiery in nature, to the point where his very presence is able to stop blizzards from happening on islands as long as he is there
- ## Alternate Forms
	- ### Archer
		- Ace can typically only be summoned as an Archer class Servant. The fact that he was summoned into the Lancer class is an anomaly
		- If anyone else had tried summoning Ace, he would have been summoned into the Archer class
		- #### Description
			- What's it look like
		- #### Abilities
			- Ace is more powerful as an Archer
			- Some of his parameters are stronger than his Lancer form, with the exception of his Strength stat
			- #### Class Skills

		- #### Combat
			- ((6707087e-8c4d-464d-9a6c-4d15b78eab2a))
				- Ace ate a logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into fire
				- Ace mainly uses his flames for a different kinds of offensive attacks that can create and unleash massive amounts of fire for large-scale damage as well as small precision attacks

  collapsed:: true
	- Fuckass reality marble
	  collapsed:: true
		- noble phantasm that represents the story of the war at marineford and the burning fist that went through his own chest
			- Ill never forgive you for this, anuk
			- itd be funny if this was a stella situation where using this noble phantasm just kills him. i mean i dont want it to be but god what a mean thing to do to my favorite emotional support dead guy <3
			- Oh hang on. Servant ascension. He gets a power upgrade by going through thr war at marineford
				- Whats rhe story reason beihind ascension? How can we make ace ascend and why.
				- No im gonna lose it actually. Servant ascension for ace. Stage one is 17yr old boy, second ascension is the second division commander, and his final ascension is ace from the war at marineford
			- Fuckoff powerful but takes a lot of mana. He transforms into his adult self and dies to explode everything around him. Its a bomb that goes off and kills him in the process / leaves him unable to keep fighting. so if this doesnt kill his enemy hes kinda fucked
			- Good thing hes a servant and servants arent people otherwise hed die from being killed ✌️
			- Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm
			- OH FUCK OR ITS AN ANTI-UNIT NOBLE PHANTASM WHERE HE SUMMONS A REALITY MARBLE AND PUTS HIS OPPONENT THROUGH HIS OWN DEATH AT MARINEFORD
	- Notes from St Elmos Fire
	  collapsed:: true
		- Metal pipe powered by st elmos fire could go hard as a polearm
		- His main weapon is a metal pipe just like the one he used to use as a child back on Dawn Island, and just like the one sabo still uses now
			- Well, almost like that one. Instead of an elbow joint at one end of it, there’s either a tee joint, wye joint, or cross joint
				- Why you ask? Because with the application of St. Elmo’s Fire (his devil fruit technique) he can create a brush of fire at the end of the pipe (in a similar way as St. Elmo’s Fire, the weather phenomena) in the shape of a blade
				- The joint at the end of the pipe is important because it points the direction where the St. Elmo’s Fire shoots out from to form the blade
				- Thats a Polearm, babey!
				- I was looking at polearms and originally think like a halberd or something but maybe he has a naginata like the one Whitebeard had
					- Ace may be younger, but his story is still closely associated with Whitebeard’s, and Ace is still his beloved son. Why shouldn’t he have a weapon similar to his father’s

	- [Broken Ace](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce): Portgas D. Ace. One of the most powerful pirates under Whitebeard's command, owning nearly everyone he comes across...until he meets Blackbeard. After being imprisoned in Impel Down, he is revealed to have a lot of angst about his father (none other than Gold Roger) and barely even wanting to live. And once his little brother Luffy frees him and gives him a second chance? He takes a lava punch from a [General Ripper](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper) to protect the poor kid, then dies in his arms. To explain how badly broken Ace was, one must know the [Driving Question](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion) of his life. The question which he spent his *entire* life searching for, that he continued to live to find the answer to...was whether or not he deserved to be born. He was *that* broken.
